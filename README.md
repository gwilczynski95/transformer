## My very own Transformer fun in Pytorch ðŸ˜Š

In this repo I try to implement the Transformer from the famous 
[Attention is All You Need paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf).

It's task will be, of course, the translation task.

### Note

If you feel this README lacks something - let me know, I'll fix this. Or if you have any idea on how to improve this
project, once again, let me know ðŸ˜Š.
